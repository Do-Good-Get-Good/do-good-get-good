### Firebase

We are using two different firebase environments.
The first one `do-good-get-good-2f6cc` is the production environment and the second one `dev-do-good-get-good` is the development environment.

### Development accounts

1. admin@dev.com - Super Admin account

Super Admin accounts have the following permissions:

- Create new users (user, admin and superadmin)
- Update and inactivate all users
- Create, read, update and delete activities
- Link and unlink users to activities

Admin accounts have same permissions as superadmin except for:

- Creating admin/super admin accounts
- Can only update users linked to their account
